# builtbywill.dev — Developer Portfolio

Had a little time after work, so I knocked out a clean layout, smooth animations, and a responsive UI that actually feels good.

This site is my professional portfolio as I transition from sales to tech.  
It’s where I showcase what I’ve been building — real apps, shipped fast, with real intent behind them.

**Built with:**
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
- FontAwesome Icons
- Google Fonts
