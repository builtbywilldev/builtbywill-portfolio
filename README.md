# builtbywill.dev — Developer Portfolio

Had a little time after work today, so I knocked out a clean navbar and hero section.

This site will eventually serve as my professional portfolio as I transition from sales to tech. 
It's where I’ll showcase what I’ve been building — real apps, shipped fast, with real intent behind them.

Built with:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- FontAwesome Icons
- Google Fonts

### What’s Done:
✅ Responsive Navbar  
✅ Header/Hero section  
✅ Theme toggle + basic styling  

### What’s Next:
🔧 Projects section  
📱 Mobile polish  
🧠 Maybe some Morpheus integration if things get wild

Live preview coming soon. Until then:
