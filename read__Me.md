# builtbywill.dev — Developer Portfolio

Had a little time after work today, so I knocked out a clean layout and some sweet animations.

This site will eventually serve as my professional portfolio as I transition from sales to tech.  
It's where I’ll showcase what I’ve been building — real apps, shipped fast, with real intent behind them.

Built with:
- HTML5
- CSS3 (`block__element--modifier` if you know, you know)
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- FontAwesome Icons
- Google Fonts

Live preview coming soon. Until then:

Stay tuned. And yes, I BEM’d the README.
